# Education Shifts Perception Application

* **Educates people in BC** about AI tools in a clear, approachable way.
* **Reduces hype & fear** by showing practical, real-world benefits.
* **Acts as a proof-of-concept** for how education shifts perception from fear to curiosity.

Here’s a structured plan for a **minimal viable product (MVP)** you can develop in the hackathon timeframe.

---

## **1. Core Idea**

Create a **"AI Discovery & Comfort Tool"** — a simple, interactive web or mobile app that:

1. **Assesses user’s familiarity and concerns** with AI in under 1 minute.
2. **Matches them with bite-sized, relevant AI tool demos** (e.g., text summarization, language translation, image generation).
3. **Shows real examples tailored to their interests** (e.g., “AI for students,” “AI for small businesses,” “AI for seniors”).
4. **Tracks their change in perception** by asking a quick before/after question (“How comfortable are you with AI now?”).

## **2. Features for MVP**

You don’t need a huge system — focus on **3 core screens**:

**Screen 1: Quick Survey**

* Ask 3–4 multiple choice questions:

  * "How familiar are you with AI tools?" (scale 1–5)
  * "What’s your main feeling about AI?" (Excited / Curious / Neutral / Concerned / Fearful)
  * "Which areas of life are you curious about AI helping with?" (Work / Education / Creativity / Daily life)

**Screen 2: Personalized Demo**

* Based on answers, show **one small, interactive example**:

  * If they’re curious about creativity → try an AI that turns a sentence into a short poem or image.
  * If they’re into daily life → AI generates a grocery list from a recipe name.
  * If they’re into education → AI summarizes an article into bullet points.
* Each example includes **a plain-language explanation** of *how* it works and *where* it’s useful.

**Screen 3: Reflection & Comfort Score**

* Ask: “How comfortable do you feel about AI after this demo?” (scale 1–5).
* Show a comparison between **Before vs After**.
* Give a “Next steps” list — 3 beginner-friendly AI tools they can try for free.

---

## **3. Why This Works**

* **Interactive** → users see AI in action, not just hear about it.
* **Personalized** → aligns with their interests, making it feel relevant.
* **Measurable impact** → you can show in the hackathon that comfort levels increased after the tool.
* **Scalable idea** → in the future, more demos can be added for different skill levels.

---

## **4. Tech Stack for Hackathon**

Keep it lean:

* **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JS (or React if you want quick components).
* **Backend / AI API:**

  * Use OpenAI API for text/image generation demos.
  * Could also use Hugging Face Spaces (free hosting + AI demos).
* **Data Storage:** Firebase or even local browser storage for MVP.
* **Hosting:** Netlify / Vercel (free, instant deploy).

---

## **5. Bonus Touches for Hackathon Presentation**

* Include **mock analytics**: “From 10 test users, comfort score rose 2 points on average.”
* Add **trust markers**: a short note on ethics, privacy, and the fact that AI output isn’t always correct.
* Use **clear visuals** — fear drops when concepts are made tangible.

---

If you want, I can **draft a clickable prototype in Figma** or **code a working MVP** that asks the survey, shows the demo, and collects before/after data. That way, you’d have something to *show* rather than just describe.
